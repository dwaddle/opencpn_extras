opencpn_extras
==============

Set of extra files for use with OpenCPN

As the repository grows we'll improve the directory structure. 

UserIcons - pretty self explanatory
tcdata - more tide data
layers - useful gpx files to display as layers
	navigation - genreally waypoints useful for navigational purposes
	weather - useful layers relating to weather services or features


We absolutely welcome additions, so feel free to fork and add/move where necessary.

thanks
