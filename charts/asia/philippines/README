These scripts will help to download MOST of the topographic charts 
provided free on the NAMRIA website.

NOTE: Please note that there are errors with the webpage links so 
not ALL charts will be downloaded with this script. The errors have
been reported to the website, so perhaps in the future this notice 
can be removed.
